# Evrey's Modded Stronghold Crusader AIVs

The *V* in *AIV* stands for *Village*, by the way.

## What is it and how to install it?

This is a mod for the game [Stronghold Crusader HD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40970/Stronghold_Crusader_HD/) that replaces all of the original AI lord castles with new and improved ones from me, [Evrey](https://github.com/Evrey). To use this mod you have to download or clone this repository and copy all files from the `./aiv/` directory to the `aiv` directory of your Stronghold Crusader installation, replacing all the 128 original files. For the Steam version of Stronghold Crusader HD, this directory is located at `<Steam Directory>/steamapps/common/Stronghold Crusader Extreme/aiv/`. If you want to have Firefly's original AI castles back, you can copy the files from `./firefly_vanilla/` to the game's `aiv` directory.

## Why would I want to use modded AI castles?

There are tons of issues with Firefly's original AI castles that have *never* been fixed, some not even since *Stronghold Crusader's* first release back in September 2002. *(The original release only had 8 AI lords instead of today's 16.)*

- Two castles of the Snake don't have an entrance. The Snake imprisons himself, starving his people to death and thus removes all the exterior *(i.e. unreachable)* industry. This even happens in campaign missions, making him a useless ally in one mission.
- Two other castles of the Snake have wall sections with towers that are unreachable, due to missing stairs or connections to a gatehouse. This renders half of his castle's defense useless.
- In many castles Firefly forgot to give Richard his tunnelor guilds. Thus, Richard cannot dig tunnels during sieges, making Elon Musk very disappointed.
- One of the Caliph's castles has his only gatehouse placed in such a perfect way, that a cactus nearby his castle blocks the entrance, rendering the Caliph as useless during this campaign mission as the Snake.
- One of King Philip's castles is actually missing an armoury, which means that he will *never* recruit an army.
- One of the Sheriff's castles is missing an engineer's guild. No catapult fun for him, then!
- The Rat's castles exist.
- Though most of the Wolf's castles do look pretty cool *(though unrealistic)*, most of them have terrible economy paths, resulting in such a bad economy that the Wolf can barely raise some armies or recruit any defenders. In addition to that, many castles of him are just too big for just about every map.
- In all castles of the Abbot and in quite some castles of the Wolf, the only gatehouse is facing south. Not just that, but those castles also tend to be quite broad... too broad for many positions on many maps, even during campaign missions. This results in the Abbot and the Wolf imprisoning themselves in their own castles by blocking the only paths leading to their southern gates.
- Some AI castles are only accessible through a drawbridge. While drawbridges are awesome, they are problematic in this game. If you destroy the gatehouses to which the drawbridges are connected, and if the besieged AI lord cannot get any more stone and wood *(bankrupt or destroyed market)* to repair the gatehouse and drawbridge, then he is imprisoned by his own moat. And as an AI lord does never delete his own moat, this results in him staying bankrupt and imprisoned forever.
- There are many, many more issues with the original AI castles.

## What does this Mod better than Firefly?

Note that the modded AI castles have been tested with all 80 campaign missions of *Stronghold Crusader HD*. The campaign of *Stronghold Crusader Extreme HD* has not yet been tested, as most maps of this game have way, waaay too small areas for AI lords to build their castles on. This means that the AI can almost never build the whole castle, resulting in frustrating fixing and testing sessions. Besides that, as Firefly tends to always choose the same castles of an AI lord for tight spots, fixing this castle in one campaign mission is very likely to break in in an other mission. This is especially true for the Caliph and the Wazir.

- There are no bugs in the castles. No missing gatehouses, no gatehouses facing the wrong directions, no missing tunnelor or engineer guilds, etc.
- Except for the Snake, all moat-digging AI lords have at least one line of gatehouses without a drawbridge, so that they won't imprison themselves with their own moat.
- No castle sections or gatehouses are cut off by vegetation *(e.g. cacti)* in the campaign missions. At least once thanks to friendly glitch power without negative side effects. *(In one mission, the Sultan is allowed to build his mercenary post on impassable stones, without negative effects on any player. Other times the AI puts barracks etc. on trees. This seems to be a purposefully implemented feature from Firefly, making AI villages more tolerant for the surrounding terrain.)*
- The Abbot always builds his cathedral before he builds his market. Otherwise the Abbot tends to go on a fast shopping tour, making him bankrupt right before he is about to invest that 1000 gold for his only source of melee troups.
- The bigger AI castles, especially those of the Abbot and the Wolf, always have multiple entrances on different sides. This makes it highly unlikely that the AI would imprison itself due to ridiculously narrow terrain. In addition to that, it makes it unlikely that all the gatehouses will be closed during a siege.
- Many of the economy paths have been optimised, especially the Wolf's and Nizar's.
- The Rat actually has a castle now.
- Sometimes this mod follows the basic design ideas of Firefly, and sometimes this mod does its own thing. All in all, though, all AI lords still have a distinct style not too far away from vanilla.
- Most castles have become more dangerous than the vanilla ones, especially the Pig's.
- All castles have a similar and sometimes even the exact same number of buildings as the vanilla castles use. This is mainly required due to hard coded economical AI behaviour. This basically means *"if vanilla Saladin has 12 houses in castle #7, then the modded Saladin also has 12 houses in castle #7"*.
- All castles also stay within the vanilla castle's bounding box, often times being smaller due to a more compact design. E.g. *"if castle #X of AI lord Y extends far to the keep's right while being 20 tiles in broadth, then the modded castle #X of lord Y also extends far to the right and is about 20 or even less tiles in broadth"*. This is very important, as most of the time specific castles of an AI lord are cherry-picked due to their shape, so that it definitely fits the map during a campaign mission. Shape meaning the castle ID. There is no code in the game analysing a castle's geometrical properties. The most notable example of this is castle #8 of the Wolf, which is this tiny little thingy Firefly likes to put near a map's borders.
- Most AI lords have an *"easter egg castle"*, i.e. a castle that is just... weird but still fits their style.

## The new AI Lords

### The Rat

![Screenshot of the new Rat's castle](./img/rat.png)

The Rat now actually builds a proper castle, which is inspired by Norman Keeps. The Rat tends to enclose his granary and armoury within his extended keep, securing their contents better than the rest of his castle. In crusader mode skirmishes, the Rat puts countless archers on the towers, making him somewhat well-defended. Oh, and his economy is a bit stronger, allowing the Rat to spam more attacks.

As an easter egg, allied AI lords sometimes dig a moat to further improve the Rat's defences.

### The Snake

![Screenshot of the new Snake's castle](./img/snake.png)

The Snake still keeps the idea of having curvy walls. He uses the great round towers to connect more wall sections to the innermost castle wall and even makes use of tower ballist√¶. His new castles are also more space-efficient, allowing the Snake to fit into tighter map sections or even right next to a neighbour without any issues.

As an hommage to this stupid self-imprisoning, the Snake is the only drawbridge-using AI lord who does not also build a drawbridge-less backup gatehouse.

### The Pig

![Screenshot of the new Pig's castle](./img/pig.png)

All in all, the pig still builds his... weird... wall thing with low walls. Granted, it does have style. This time, however, the Pig separates his castle into three sections. The first section is his inner castle, using high walls and having his biggest towers connected to them. Around this section the new Pig has a living section full of houses on one side of his castle, and a weapon making section on the opposite side. All three sections are finally enclosed with an outer, lower wall with smaller towers. To further improve the Pig, his castle now makes use of tower mangonels. Good thing there aren't any campaign missions where you or your allies have your castles right next to a Pig, right...? Right...?!

### The Wolf

![Screenshot of the new Wolf's castle](./img/wolf.png)

The new Wolf will look quite familiar, but there are some subtle and some more notable changes. First of all, his architecture has been unified. In Vanilla, most castles of the Wolf look so different from each other that they migh as well belong to entirely different AI lords. Not this time. In addition to that, his castles became more compact, making his economy more efficient and allowing him to dig bigger pitch moats. Being more compact also has the benefit that more artillery troops on more towers can attack your armies at the same time, due to decreased distances between the Wolf's towers.

As an easter egg the Wolf now also builds good stuff instead of gallows and what not, due to several hints in the lore of *Stronghold 3*. *(Yes, as a game Stronghold 3 is rubbish, but it had good ideas and the story around the Wolf was pretty neat.)*

### Sultan Saladin

![Screenshot of the new Saladin's castle](./img/saladin.png)

You might recognise his typical vanilla architecture, but you'll also notice what has changed. He became more tank-y, surrounding his outer buildings *(simple houses, most of the time)* with a lower wall, and putting all of his big towers to the front line. This makes a frontal assault on Saladin's castle quite punishing and protects him from his nemesis. The vanilla saladin was just too easy to set on fire.

### The Caliph

![Screenshot of the new Caliph's castle](./img/caliph.png)

Oh, did you like his towers? Yeah, how do I say this... err... well, there is more of 'em. Lots more. Quite a forest of toothpick towers, in fact. And the Caliph always has an outer wall now. Would be quite ironic if the pyromaniac himself was still easy to set fire on. Oh, talking about fire, did you like his pitch moats? Yeah, how do I say this... err... well, there is more of 'em. Lots more. The Caliph also gained a thicker inner wall, so that you don't immediately have a breach if you destroy one of those toothpick towers.

Remember how all of the Caliph's castles are *(at least somewhat in some cases)* rectangular? As an easter egg one of his castle's is L-shaped. And in an other of his castles the outer wall goes straight through his inner wall.

### The Sultan

![Screenshot of the new Sultan's castle](./img/sultan.png)

Well... prettier and more compact. More comparable to a little palace than an actual castle. But it is the Sultan we're talking about.

As an easter egg in one of his castles the Sultan's keep has four corner toothpick towers. With enough imagination, this gives his keep a *Hagia Sophia* -ish look.

### King Richard the Lionheart

![Screenshot of the new Richard's castle](./img/richard.png)

Remember how easy it was to set Richard on fire? Well, no more, as he now protects his outer castle buildings with a small outer wall. He also always builds two tower ballist√¶ and two tower mangonels now, whereas vanilla Richard had sometimes three and sometines four big towers.

Most notably all of his castles are an easter egg. Does the inner castle look familiar to you? Well, the two smaller towers are different, but all in all Richard now builds the castle from the cover art and title screen of *Stronghold Crusader*. I wonder why Firefly didn't have this idea. Seems obvious to me.

### Kaiser Friedrich Barbarossa

![Screenshot of the new Frederick's castle](./img/frederick.png)

This castle has propably the most historically accurate layout you'll ever see in a Stronghold game. As an easter egg, all of Frederick's castles are architecturally inspired by the castle of N√ºrnberg. This castle is known to have been the favourite residence of many emperors of the so-called *Holy Empire* and thus I gave it to Frederick.

Frederick's castles consist of three sections, one in front of the next one. To improve his castle's defences, a section's walls are never connected to an other section's walls. And thus, unlike e.g. the castles of the original Wolf, you cannot take over the whole castle by pushing just one siege tower somewhere against the walls. The original castle is built on a hill-rock-thing. To compensate for the lack of such positions in *Stronghold Crusader*, Frederick's castles are surrounded by a thick moat.

### King Philip

![Screenshot of the new Philip's castle](./img/philip.png)

Well, it's Philip, so don't expect a defensive architectural masterpiece. Though he does have a proper castle this time. Philip also keeps a lightweight version of his vanilla castles' walls.

His inner castle is losely based on half the layout of the Bastille, a former fortification at the walls of Paris.

### The Wazir

![Screenshot of the new Wazir's castle](./img/wazir.png)

He went from star-shaped castles to a triangular one. Sometimes the Wazir adds external bastions to his inner castle, making it a double-triangle or six-pointed star. This shape allows him to keep his star-ish style while also being more space-efficient. Now, more of his bread industry can be built inside his inner castle, securing it from fires. The new Wazir also makes better use of moats, including the pitch ones. Oh, and did I mention that the Wazir now makes use of tower-mounted siege engines?

As a surprise, a few of his castles have a double-gatehouse with flanking towers.

### The Emir

![Screenshot of the new Emir's castle](./img/emir.png)

The new Emir now has an outer and an inner castle wall. His basic style is somewhat kept intact: An octagonal castle with big round towers and gatehouses on the edges. Unlike his vanilla design, though, the Emir's toothpick towers are no longer a path-blocking extension of his inner castle, but are connected to the corners or sometimes edges of his lower outer wall. This gives Emir's castle the feeling of a miniature city with a massive palace at its center.

As an easter egg, one of the Emir's castles has its walls swapped: The outer city wall is high, big, and has massive towers, whereas the inner wall is small, thin, and has those toothpicks attached to it.

### The Nizar

![Screenshot of the new Nizar's castle](./img/nizar.png)

There are quite some changes made to the Nizar, though it might not seem like it at first. The most important change is that his new village is at least slightly more compact than his vanilla ones, allowing the moat to start earlier and thus be much wider. Oh, I forgot... *ahem*... *"Oh, did you like his moats? Yeah, how do I say this... err... well, there is more of 'em. Lots more."* But why? Being wider makes it easier for the Nizar to enclose his own farms with moat, in case he is placed too near to an oasis. As moats have a lower priority than buildings, the AI will never remove a farm to dig moats. For the Nizar this means that a farm nearby can create a huge opening in his moat, rendering all of his gatehouse defences useless. If, however, his farms are fully enclosed with moat and are thus unreachable, the Nizar will delete this farm and then dig his moat where the farm once was. To help him removing his own farms from his moat, the new Nizar builds sun ray walls into his moat.

An other design change is that his paths into the inner castle have been shortened a lot. What you see in this screenshot is his longest path. In vanilla, quite a few of the Nizar's castles have passages of up to four times this length, resulting in quite a weak economy. In addition to that, after a certain length it is way less dangerous to just fill up the whole moat in a straight line towards the keep than to send your army in circles along the entrance path, making those paths worse than useless.

Finally, the Nizar's gatehouses became a bit fancier, thanks to the addition of flanking towers.

### The Sheriff

![Screenshot of the new Sheriff's castle](./img/sheriff.png)

Do you like his vanilla design? Well, I do, which is why I kept the style. The Sheriff's new castles are basically a more compact version of the vanilla ones with added crenelations. As you might notice, one of the reasons why his new castles are so much more compact is that his houses are now placed outside of his castle. The Sheriff now collides less with the terrain or his neighbours.

Putting the poor civilian's houses outside of his fine and noble castle's walls certainly fits his character of being a cruel tyrant always raising taxes, even if the tax rate overshoots 100%. Gallows tower his low outer wall, so that everyone on the outside can see what happens to those who are too poor to pay. Thus, as an easter egg, one of the Sheriff's castles is completely reversed in its design. The outer village wall now encloses all the houses, banning the barracks outside. The village wall is high and thick, having big gatehouses and towers, giving the village extra protection. On the other hand, the Sheriff's inner castle has low and thin walls, small towers and a small gatehouse, making it the weakest part of this easter egg castle.

### The Marshall

![Screenshot of the new Marshall's castle](./img/marshall.png)

As with the Rat, you might not recognise the Marshall's new castle, at all, in that he now actually builds a rectangular starfort. He builds an inner starfort with high walls and an outer smaller wall in all of his castles. Especially due to his very low number of defensive archers, he really needs such an improved fortification to survive enemy attacks at all.

The Marshall is the only AI lord who does not build any towers, at all. There are two reasons for that. First, this speeds up repairing the fortification a lot. The AI is very slow at saving stones for towers, as the few stones on the stockpile are quickly used to build walls instead. Second, a proper starfort is all bastions and maybe a watchtower in the center.


### The Abbot

![Screenshot of the new Abbot's castle](./img/abbot.png)

Again, a castle you might not recognise at all. This time, however, it is quite easy to just guess who lives there. The new Abbot's castle now has a shape similar to floor plans of gothic cathedrals. In addition to that, the new Abbot's castles are more compact than his vanilla ones and always have multiple entrances, fixing all those issues where the Abbot would imprison himself in way too tight spaces.

As a fun fact, the Abbot is the first AI lord I ever modded. Back then I just added a secondary front gatehouse to all of his castles.

As an easter egg, one of his castles is turned by 45¬∞, resulting in an actual cross shape as seen by the player, instead of an X shape due to the isometric perspective.

## How can I contribute?

### Creating a Pull/Merge Request

As mentioned before, the *Stronghold Crusader Extreme* campaign is untested and might need a lot of fixes. At the same time, there might still be slight issues with the original 80 mission campaign or during random skirmish matches you might want to fix. You will need an installation of this game and the *"Stronghold Crusader AIV Editor"* to make any patches. To get the AIV editor, open your favourite search engine and look for *"Stronghold Crusader Community Tools"* or *"Stronghold Crusader Modding Tools"*. Once you have downloaded those tools, you have to copy this mod's files from the `./aiv/` folder into the AIV editor's `villages` folder. After that is done, you can start editing the AI castle files.

- Make sure that your fixes don't break any of the 80 campaign missions of *Stronghold Crusader*. As a fast check you can start a match at a speed of 90 and observe what the AI lords build during the first 3 to 10 minutes. In tighter spaces, however, longer observation will be required, as too many blocked houses will break the AI's industry thanks to a lack of workers.
- Also make sure that your fixes don't break the architectural style of this mod.
- The first construction steps of an AI lord should be, in order:
	1. More Stockpiles
	2. Granary
	3. Armoury
	4. Cathedral (Abbot)
	5. Barracks / Mercenary Post
	6. Engineer's Guild
	7. Tunnerlor's Guild (Richard)
	8. All the houses
	9. First wall sections
	10. Maybe first gatehouses or towers
- Make sure to insert 30-steps breaks at specific castle construction steps to give the AI time to collect e.g. more stone for towers to be built after the breaks.
- Don't forget to copy any changes back to your working copy of this repository. Also don't forget to copy your changes to your installation of *Stronghold Crusader* to test your changes.

If you are done editing your AI villages, submit a pull request containing the following information:

- Describe what you changed.
- Describe *why* you changed specific things. This is most important.
- Please, add a screenshot showing the issue with the original mod castle.
- Please, also add a screenshot showing your changes in action.
- If your pull request fixes specific campaign missions, then list them as `Crusader #1-80` or `Extreme #1-25`.
- If your pull request fixes a custom skirmish match, then add the following information:
	- Add a screenshot showing your custom skirmish configuration.
	- The screenshot needs to show the chosen AI opponents, their colours, their names, and their positions on the map.
	- The screenshot also needs to show the game mode and the start resources.
	- And it obviously needs to show the chosen map. Only Firefly originals in single player mode are valid. No fixes for custom maps made by the comminity or yourself. If an AI lord has an issue with custom-made maps, then fix the custom-made maps. Also don't submit fixes for something that occurred during a multiplayer game, as this makes it hard to reproduce the original issues.

### Just filing an Issue

In case you don't feel competent enough to use Firefly's AIV Editor, or if the AIV Editor simply doesn't work on your computer and operating system, or if you just lack the time to fix things yourself, you can just file an issue, so that I can have a look at the problem and fix it myself. Though I cannot guarantee to have time for that myself right away, I will eventually.

When creating an issue, I will need about the same information as for pull requests:

- Describe what should be changed.
- Describe why this should be changed.
- Add a screenshot showing the issue you have.
- If the issue occurred during specific campaign missions, then list them as `Crusader #1-80` or `Extreme #1-25`.
- If this issue occurred during a custom skirmish match, then add the following information:
	- Add a screenshot showing your custom skirmish configuration.
	- The screenshot needs to show the chosen AI opponents, their colours, their names, and their positions on the map.
	- The screenshot also needs to show the game mode and the start resources.
	- And it obviously needs to show the chosen map. Only Firefly originals in single player mode are valid. Don't file issues for custom maps made by the comminity or yourself. If an AI lord has an issue with custom-made maps, then fix the custom-made maps. Also don't submit issues for something that occurred during a multiplayer game, as this makes it hard to reproduce the original issues.

### Suggesting a re-design of an AI lord

In case you have an idea on how to improve the castle designs of a specific AI lord, e.g. if you have an idea for sexier Sultan castles, then feel free to create an issue so that we can discuss your ideas.

As exact castle layouts in *Stronghold Crusader* are hard to describe, you should add pictures in your issue showing your design ideas. Those pictures can be any of...

- ... pencil drawings on paper.
- ... a screenshot of an AI lord's or your own castle while in the game. In ye olden days, I used the sandbox mode or the map editor to plan AI castles.
- ... a screenshot of the AIV Editor showing your new castle design, propably accompanied by the actual `.aiv` file.

Also, don't forget to mention which castle(s) your designs are meant to replace, what the benefits of your designs are, what you missed in the original mod designs, etc.
